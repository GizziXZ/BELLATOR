## Game

if you don't want to get spoiled, i wouldn't recommend reading the code but if you're insistent on doing so, it's better to have someone else who won't play the game read the code for you to avoid spoilers.

### How do I play?

Make sure you have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) installed

inside the `BELLATOR` folder, run
```bash
npm i
```

to run the game either use the `play.bat` file or I personally recommend running the file in a new terminal window and running
```bash
node index.js
```
it's better to run it using `node index.js` as your window won't instantly close on encountering an error and helps out with bugfixing!
